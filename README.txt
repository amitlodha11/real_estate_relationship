Thank you for the opportunity to interview at Point 72. 

In this folder you will find the code, writeup and presentation slide as requested by the case parameters. 

The code has been included in three ways. 
1. jupyter notebook (pynb)
2. python file (.py)
3. html file to be viewed in a browser 

The code needs to be in the same directory as the 'Original Data' directory in order to run successfully.
